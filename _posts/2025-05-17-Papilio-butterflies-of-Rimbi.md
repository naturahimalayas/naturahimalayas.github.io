During a short field trip to Rimbi, a small village in Gyalshing district of Sikkim, in May, 2025, accompanied by Amit da, Bias di, and Subhajit da, guided by Sonam da, good activity of _Papilio_ swallowtail butterflies was observed.

Among peacock butterflies, Blue Peacock (_Papilio arcturus_), Common Peacock (_Papilio bianor_), and Krishna Peacock (_Papilio krishna_), were found puddling on wet river beds.
