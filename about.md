I'm Dr. Aaratrik Pal, a naturalist, a photographer, and a taxonomist, based in India. I've completed my PhD from [University of North Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Bengal), in Botany. My PhD thesis dealt with the diversity, nomenclature, palynology, systematics, and taxonomy of Linderniacee from the Eastern Himalaya, India.

Moreover, I'm broadly interested in the biodiversity of butterflies, damselflies, dragonflies and plants, as well as their documentations, nomenclature, systematics, and taxonomy.

You can check my [Google Scolar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=47j3o8IAAAAJ&hl=en) for more about my research.

I also have a blog about dragonflies and damselflies in Bengali, [BanglarForing](https://draggal.wordpress.com/).
